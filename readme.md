# Barangay Information Portal System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Barangay Information Portal System** is a web-based application designed to digitize and centralize barangay services in the Philippines. It aims to improve communication between barangay officials and residents, reduce manual processes, and promote transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in local governance.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. Barangay Announcements & News

**Description:**
A centralized page where barangay officials can post announcements such as meetings, curfews, clean-up drives, and emergency advisories.

**Why this is needed:**
Many residents miss important announcements because they rely solely on social media or word of mouth. This feature ensures that official information is always accessible in one trusted platform.

---

### 2. Online Barangay Certificate Requests

**Description:**
Residents can request documents such as Barangay Clearance, Certificate of Indigency, and Certificate of Residency through the system.

**Why this is needed:**
Manual processing causes long queues and requires multiple visits to the barangay hall. Online requests save time and reduce congestion.

---

### 3. Request Tracking System

**Description:**
Residents can track the status of their document requests (Pending, Approved, Ready for Pickup).

**Why this is needed:**
This reduces repeated follow-ups and improves communication between residents and barangay staff.

---

### 4. Barangay Officials & Staff Directory

**Description:**
Displays a list of barangay officials, their positions, office hours, and contact details.

**Why this is needed:**
Residents often do not know who to approach for specific concerns. This promotes transparency and accountability.

---

### 5. Incident & Complaint Reporting

**Description:**
Allows residents to submit reports or complaints regarding barangay-related issues such as noise complaints, disputes, or infrastructure problems.

**Why this is needed:**
Provides a formal and documented way to report issues, encouraging early resolution and proper record-keeping.

---

### 6. Barangay Events & Calendar

**Description:**
A calendar displaying upcoming barangay events, assemblies, and activities.

**Why this is needed:**
Improves community participation and ensures residents are informed ahead of time.

---

### 7. Resident & Household Records Management

**Description:**
Stores resident and household information including senior citizens, PWDs, and other classifications.

**Why this is needed:**
Accurate records are essential for relief distribution, social services, and official reporting to higher government units.

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard & Reports

**Description:**
Provides barangay officials with summarized data such as total residents, number of requests, and common complaints.

**Why this is needed:**
Supports data-driven decision-making and simplifies report generation.
